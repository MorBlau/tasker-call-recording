# Enable call recording project
This tasker project enables call recording on OnePlus phones.

To enable call recording follow these steps:

1. Install tasker (note that tasker is a paid app. I have no affiliation with the task or its owner).
2. Import the profile and task from this project.

Tested on OnePlus 6, on both Android 10 and 11.
I cannot guarantee that it will work on any other phone. If it works (or doesn't work) for you, please feel free to let me know at mor.blau@gmail.com, and I will add the phone/OS here.
